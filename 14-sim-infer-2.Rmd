## Exercises

Follow along with examples from today's lecture. See if you obtain similar
conclusions to what we found in lecture.

1. **Answered in class** Analyze the Manhattan data. Is there enough evidence to suggest that the
mean price of a one-bedroom apartment is greater than 2400? Why or why not?
2. **Answered in class** Analyze the yawning data. Is there enough evidence to suggest that yawning
and observing someone yawn are not independent? Why or why not?
3. Analyze the Manhattan data. Is there enough evidence to suggest that the *median* price of a one-bedroom apartment is greater than 2400? Why or why not?
4. Interpret your conclusion from Exercise 3 in context of the research question. What does the p-value represent?
